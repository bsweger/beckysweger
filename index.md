## Work

A few things I do/did.

### DATA Act: USAspending API

Led the buildout of an API that presents, for the first time, a unified view of U.S. spending data. In addition to being available for public use, the API powers [beta.usaspending.gov](https://beta.usaspending.gov).

### DATA Act: Data Ingest and Validation

I was deeply involved in the "DATA Act Broker," a product that federal agencies use to submit and validate their spending data to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Over a period of two years, the broker evolved from a series of Python scripts to a Jupyter notebook, and finally to a mature, API-driven data ingest site that performs hundreds of validations on incoming files and is used by dozens of federal agencies.

### Fedspending

A project I started to explore and write about federal spending data. For example: [https://bsweger.github.io/fedspending/writing/hierarchy_start_bottom.html](https://bsweger.github.io/fedspending/writing/hierarchy_start_bottom.html).

### Pandas Snippets

Pandas is a powerful data analysis toolkit. But sometimes you just need a quick reference for doing common data cleaning and munging tasks.

### State Smart

Because a single source of federal spending data was not available back in 2015, I designed a website that pulled together many disparate data sources to tell the story of how federal dollars flow into and out of states. In addition to writing the narrative, I researched the best sources for the required information (making some hard decisions along the way) and coded the ETL (extract, transform, and load) needed to power the site.

### Hack for Western Mass

The inaugural National Day of Civic Hacking happened in 2013. Rather than travel to New York or Boston to participate, I gathered a team of local technologists to organize our own Western Massachusetts-flavored hackathon. I served on the organizing committee in 2013 and 2014 before passing the torch.

### Computers are for People

A technical blog that I haven't updated in years. I keep it around as evidence that I can write. Some of my favorite (if somewhat dated) posts:

* [Getting R to work in a notebook running on Windows](http://www.swegler.com/becky/blog/2014/08/03/ipython-ipython-notebook-anaconda-and-r-rpy2/)
* [Tutorials for running Python, Django, and MySQL on Windows, back when it was harder](http://www.swegler.com/becky/blog/2011/09/14/python-django-and-mysql-on-windows-7/)
* [Making Excel charts less...ugly](http://www.swegler.com/becky/blog/2012/01/29/no-excuses-for-ugly-excel-charts/)
