tagline: A tagline highlights your approach.
intro: |
  The tagline should inspire confidence and interest, focusing on the value that your overall approach offers to your audience. Use a heading typeface and keep your tagline to just a few words, and don’t confuse or mystify.

  Use the right side of the grid to explain the tagline a bit more. What are your goals? How do you do your work? Write in the present tense, and stay brief here. People who are interested can find details on internal pages.

## Work

A few things I do/did.

### DATA Act: USAspending API

Led the buildout of an API that presents, for the first time, a unified view of U.S. spending data. In addition to being available for public use, the API powers [beta.usaspending.gov](https://beta.usaspending.gov).

### DATA Act: Data Ingest and Validation

I was deeply involved in the "DATA Act Broker," a product that federal agencies use to submit and validate their spending data to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Over a period of two years, the broker evolved from a series of Python scripts to a Jupyter notebook, and finally to a mature, API-driven data ingest site that performs hundreds of validations on incoming files and is used by dozens of federal agencies.

### Fedspending

A project I started to explore and write about federal spending data. For example: [https://bsweger.github.io/fedspending/writing/hierarchy_start_bottom.html](https://bsweger.github.io/fedspending/writing/hierarchy_start_bottom.html).

### Pandas Snippets

Pandas is a powerful data analysis toolkit. But sometimes you just need a quick reference for doing common data cleaning and munging tasks.

### State Smart

Because a single source of federal spending data was not available back in 2015, I designed a website that pulled together many disparate data sources to tell the story of how federal dollars flow into and out of states. In addition to writing the narrative, I researched the best sources for the required information (making some hard decisions along the way) and coded the ETL (extract, transform, and load) needed to power the site.

### Hack for Western Mass

The inaugural National Day of Civic Hacking happened in 2013. Rather than travel to New York or Boston to participate, I gathered a team of local technologists to organize our own Western Massachusetts-flavored hackathon. I served on the organizing committee in 2013 and 2014 before passing the torch.

### Computers are for People

A technical blog that I haven't updated in years. I keep it around as evidence that I can write. Some of my favorite (if somewhat dated) posts:

* [Getting R to work in a notebook running on Windows](http://www.swegler.com/becky/blog/2014/08/03/ipython-ipython-notebook-anaconda-and-r-rpy2/)
* [Tutorials for running Python, Django, and MySQL on Windows, back when it was harder](http://www.swegler.com/becky/blog/2011/09/14/python-django-and-mysql-on-windows-7/)
* [Making Excel charts less...ugly](http://www.swegler.com/becky/blog/2012/01/29/no-excuses-for-ugly-excel-charts/)

### Random Trek

I was a guest on a Star Trek podcast, which was quite fun.
