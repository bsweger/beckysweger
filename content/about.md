 I'm a technical leader and software engineer who specializes in designing, building, and shipping data-centric applications. 
 
 Currently a Principal Data Engineer at [Trello](https://trello.com) (Atlassian), I previously held an appointment at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov), a government-embedded startup created under the Obama administration. There, I led the [technical implementation](https://usaspending.gov) of the United States' [first open data law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Accountability_and_Transparency_Act_of_2014). 
 
 A twenty-five year tech veteran, I've held leadership positions in higher education, healthcare, and the non-profit sectors.
