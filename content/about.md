I'm a tech leader and software engineer who specializes in designing, munging, and shipping data.

Currently I'm a principal data engineer for [Trello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Accountability_and_Transparency_Act_of_2014) at Atlassian.
Previously, I was a U.S. federal civil servant, serving as a tech lead and
member of the engineering team at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/),
a consultancy inside the General Services Administration.

During my 18F tenure, I lead the technical implementation of the [DATA Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Accountability_and_Transparency_Act_of_2014),
the nationâ€™s first open data law. I entered the world of public spending via
a role as the former Director of Data and Technology at [National Priorities
Project](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/), a federal budget research
organization.

A twenty-plus year tech veteran, I've held leadership positions in fields ranging
from higher education to healthcare.
